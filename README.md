# Project-486
Bundled Small Scale Solar Power Project by M/s Dharamdeep Commodities Pvt. Ltd. in Gujarat, India
__________
Project owner has signed power purchase agreement with Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited (UGVCL). With a total installed capacity of 6.6 MW (DC) the project
activity uses Monocrystalline solar photovoltaic technology make by JINENERGY to generate clean
energy. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a clean technology as there is no fossil fuel
fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process. Photovoltaic module consists of several
photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an environmentally protective laminate, which
forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted
on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it
displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the regional grid.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 8406 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
Since the project activity generates electricity through solar energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
